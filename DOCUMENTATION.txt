PROJECT: CALLIX - AI AUTONOMOUS VOICE RECEPTIONIST
================================================================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
------------------
Callix is a high-performance, industry-aware AI Voice Assistant designed to 
replace traditional receptionists. It bridges the gap between human speech and 
digital databases, allowing users to book appointments, order products, or 
provide feedback using only their voice in multiple languages (English, Telugu, Hindi).

2. CORE TECHNOLOGY STACK
-----------------------
* FRONTEND: React.js with Tailwind CSS & Framer Motion (Premium UI/UX).
* BACKEND: Node.js & Express (Robust API Layer).
* DATABASE: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database for real-time sync).
* AI (THE BRAIN): Groq AI (Llama-3 models) for near-instant reasoning.
* STT (EARS): Deepgram Nova-3 (State-of-the-art voice-to-text with <200ms latency).
* TTS (VOICE): Custom TTS Engine & Google Web Speech fallbacks (Professional female voice).

3. TECHNICAL WORKFLOW (THE FLOW)
------------------------------
A. VOICE CAPTURE: 
   The user speaks into the microphone. Deepgram Nova-3 processes the audio 
   instantly, converting it into native script (Telugu, Hindi, or English).

B. INTELLIGENT REASONING:
   The text is sent to Groq AI. The AI is grounded with "Context Data" 
   (e.g., specific doctor names, prices, or menu items) from MongoDB.
   The AI decides two things:
   1. How to respond warmly in the user's native language.
   2. Whether a "Command" needs to be executed (e.g., BOOK_APPOINTMENT).

C. ACTION EXECUTION:
   If the AI issues a command, the system automatically sends a request to 
   the Node.js backend to update the MongoDB database. This data is then 
   immediately visible on the User Dashboard.

D. VOICE RESPONSE:
   The AI's text response is converted back to speech using the TTS engine, 
   providing a natural 2-way phone-call experience.

4. KEY FEATURES FOR THE DEMO
---------------------------
* MULTI-INDUSTRY: Switch between a Hospital, a Restaurant, or a Corporate office.
* GROUNDED FACTS: The AI knows exact prices (e.g., iPhone 15 at ₹1.3L) and 
  doctor schedules because it reads them from the database.
* REAL-TIME DASHBOARD: Open the dashboard in one tab and speak to the AI in another. 
  When you book a table, it appears on the dashboard without refreshing.
* COMPACT PORTFOLIO: A professional account section where all your businesses 
  are listed in a sleek, modern UI.

5. HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT (LOCAL SETUP)
--------------------------------------
STEP 1: PREREQUISITES
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

STEP 2: BACKEND SETUP
1. Open a terminal and go to the backend folder: 'cd backend'
2. Install dependencies: 'npm install'
3. Start the server: 'npm run dev'
   - It will say "Connected to MongoDB" and "Server running on port 5000".

STEP 3: FRONTEND SETUP
1. Open a SECOND terminal in the root folder.
2. Install dependencies: 'npm install --legacy-peer-deps'
3. Start the application: 'npm run dev'
4. Open your browser to the link provided (usually http://localhost:5173).

6. DEPLOYMENT (ONLINE DEMO)
--------------------------
The project is "Deployment Ready." To host it for free online:
1. Connect this folder to GitHub.
2. Import the project into VERCEL (vercel.com).
3. Set the Environment Variables (.env) in the Vercel dashboard.
4. Vercel will give you a live HTTPS link to share with your clients.
